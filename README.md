# FiRescue

In our project we stimulate a bushfire in a forest terrain which encompasses trees, plants, bushes, stones and lakes, which is the home of various animals. Our goal is to build trained dogs which could save endangered and vulnerable animals from the fire without itself hurting from the fire. We are focussing on building the forest terrain from ground up using Unity3D. We aim to create trained bots using Unity Machine Learning agents that would learn to save the animals from the fire. 

Furthermore, we will be training dog agents on different sets of RL based algorithms in the same environment and with a fixed training period to avoid bias. This will allow us to determine which sets of algorithms work better for particular scenarios.
